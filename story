Once upon at time in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a banyan tree which was on the banks of
 the river.
in the same forest lived a giant crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocoldile came to the banks
 of the river under the banyan tree where the monkey lived.The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
 the crocodilecame back the next day to get some fruits as he loved them.
As the days past by the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
One day the monkey sent some fruits to the crocodile's wife. She ate the fruits and liked them but she was jealous 
as she did not like her husband spent time with the monkey.So she told her husband "if the fruits are so juisy,
how sweet would the monkey's heart be. Get me the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not willing to kill the 
monkey but had no choice.
